# Gold-Price-Prediction

The following Dataset contains 2290 entries of gold prices and related features over the span of 10 years. This project aims to predict the prices of gold using Machine Learning Models and through information about correlated features such as the SPX, USO, SLV, EUR/USD. The two regression models used for the prediction of gold prices are the K-Nearest Neighbour Model and Linear Regression Model. Both the KNN and Linear Regression Model were fairly successful in predicting the gold prices with a mean square error of approximately 58.138 and 67.122 respectively.
